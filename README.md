# Heart Disease Prediction System

This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction System** built using **Python** and the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier**. It predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health metrics, such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The model is trained on a dataset sourced from Kaggle.

## Project Overview

Heart disease is a leading cause of health issues worldwide. This prediction system aims to provide early risk assessments, assisting healthcare providers with timely interventions to improve patient outcomes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle and includes various health indicators for heart disease prediction.

- **Source**: [Heart Disease Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Features**: Age, blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, etc.
- **Label**: Presence or absence of heart disease.

## Features

- **Input**: Patient health metrics.
- **Output**: Predicted risk of heart disease.
- **Algorithm**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
